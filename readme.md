Implement real-time translation while the user speaks, rather than waiting until the recording finishes.Use speech-to-text (STT) as a streaming process and provide continuous translation output as audio is recorded.

Use a sentiment analysis model to classify the transcription and translation as positive, neutral, or negative. Integrate an open-source speech emotion recognition model to analyze the sentiment/emotion from the audio.

Feature: Let users choose different types of voices (male, female, young, old) for text-to-speech output.

Instead of translating to multiple preset languages, allow the user to select specific languages dynamically via a UI or command-line input. Provide an interactive menu or command-line input where users can choose the languages they want translations in.
